                <h2>Help Flood affected People Donate For medicine, food for the needy.</h2><br>
                Till date, our group has put in whatever little money we had, for day to day expenses, from our earnings.
                Our team is mostly comprised of working people and ever since the COVID-19
                pandemic hit us, most of us have lost our jobs and some of us are facing major pay cuts.

                <h2>Plant a tree, so that the next generation can get air for free.
                </h2><br>
                Trees are vital for this planet as they give us oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide, stabilize the soil and
                give
                life to the world’s wildlife.
                They also provide us with the materials for tools and shelter. Despite their importance, human beings
                are
                cutting them down for their worldly needs. This has to be minimized because
                our life is not possible without trees. Instead of cutting them, we should grow more trees.

                <h2>Donate for Women Education</h2> <br>India's female literacy has gone up but still 22 percentage points behind
                world average; education among young women. Women education in India plays a very important role in the
                overall development of the country. It not only helps in the development of half of the human resources, but
                in improving the quality of life at home and outside. 1 If it is said that education is the key to all
                problems, then it won't be improper.
